		<h1>Financial Modeling of Companies</h1>
		
		We are going to make our first model of the beloved fast food chain, McDonalds. I
		Think fast food is a really cool one to start with since most, if not all of us, have been to
		these kinds of places many times or have even worked in a fast food resturaunt before.
		We are already familiar with the menu but now we are going to dive deep into how McDonalds
		operates, where they make their money, how they spend it and so on! Let's start with a fresh
		workbook and format it so it's ready for use. Begin with a basic format like the one below. <br><br>
		
		<center><img class="scrn" src="mcd.png" width="85%" height="85%"></center><br><br>
		
		This will be the first step to modeling their Income Statement. The quarters are written as 'Q' 'n' 'yy'. 
		Where 'n' is the quarter of the year, either 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th, and 'yy' is the last two digits of the year. 
		In this case, 16 for 2016. Revenue is just a place holder for now. Don't forget to freeze the frames so 
		the model will be easy to read and navigate as we start to populate it. <br><br>

		Now before we start filling this thing in, let's look at McDonalds 'at a glance' and write down some 
		important information about where they stand right now. We are going to visit SEC.gov and Google
		to collect some data and fill out a small table in a new tab on our workbook. Make a new tab by clicking
		the plus sign at the bottom left corner of your workbook and set it up like so. <br><br>
		
		<img class="scrn" src="mcd1.png" width="45%" height="45%">
		<img class="scrn" src="mcd2.png" width="45%" height="45%">
		
		<br><br>
		
		We are going to record their current price per share and how many outstanding shares there are. 
		When we multiply these two value together we will have the companies market cap. Then we are going
		to look up their most up to date cash on hand and long-term debt. 
		
		<br><br>
		
		You may be wondering what 'EV' is. EV stands for enterprise value. This is an important value to 
		look at as it gives a better representation of what the business is worth. We get EV by taking the
		market cap, adding the debt to it, and subtracting their cash. Enterprise value is another way of saying, 
		"If I was going to buy this business today how much would I really have to spend". This should make 
		sense because if you buy a business you are also buying whatever debt they have. Which is something
		the owner of the business will eventually have to pay. You also inherit whatever cash the business has
		which means you can ignore that much of price of the business. If you bought a business for 100 dollars
		but they had 40 dollars in cash, well you only really spent 60 dollars at the end of the deal. 
		
		<br><br>
		
		And finally Net Cash is obtained by subtracting debt from current cash on hand.
