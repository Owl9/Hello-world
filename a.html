		<h1>Financial Modeling of Companies</h1>
		
		So what exactly are we trying to accomplish by making a model? Financial modeling
		is a pretty routine activity in the career path and world of Corporate Finance. Its goal
		is to look at a business and all of it's financial activities, forecast where the enterprise 
		may be heading and finally use the insight gained to make more educated decisions 
		related to investing, merging, acquiring, ect. I personally believe modeling is great first tool
		to learn if you are interested in corporate finance. The hands-on interaction with companies
		encourages you to teach yourself how different components of a business function, rather
		than just reading through a list of terms and definitions. My hope for these lessons is that
		you will be excited and motivated to not only learn these concepts, but also actively ask
		yourself questions about how to further understand the financial world. <br><br>
		
		Let's run through a couple of key components of a model and see just what we are going
		to be working with in order to make these forecasts and/or decisions. Here is a basic model
		for the popular streaming service, Netflix. Also referred to as NFLX, which is
		it's stock ticker. <br><br>
		
		<center><img class="scrn" src="nflx.png" width="85%" height="85%"></center><br><br>
		
		This is what a model will look like. As we can see we have some straightforward 
		things on here like their revenue, how much they pay in marketing for their service, 
		what they paid in taxes, margins, ect. Also note that the model is organized chronologically 
		by quarters, indicated at the top by 'Qxxx'. This is the standard way to organize our data
		since this is also how companies release their data, by quarter. We are also going to 
		record a companies Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement, as shown below.<br><br>

		Do not feel overwhelmed by the wall of numbers or words you've never heard of. We are going to 
		break the model down step by step and you will understand everything that you see at a steady pace. 
		In fact, let's jump right into it and start building a model together! <br><br>
