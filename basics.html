		Alright so hopefully you have found a spreadsheet software and fiddled around with
		it a bit. This next bit is going to assume that you have very little experience or are using
		spreadsheets for the first time. <br><br>
		
		To begin, let's just enter some arbitray data to make a table and start messing with it. 
		Start by selecting a cell and start typing some numbers or words. After filling a cell with some
		data you can press either Enter to go a cell down or Tab to go a cell to the right. You can also
		hold down Shift when pressing Enter or Tab to move up or to the left respectively. <br><br>
		
		Once you have a table of some kind built we can start practicing formulas for extracting
		meaningful data. An easy one to start with is SUM. in an empty cell below a column of data
		type '=sum(' and select all of the data you want to add together. Finish the formula with an 
		ending ')' and press enter or tab. There are many more pre defined formulas you can use 
		as well as the ability to make a unique formula. <br><br>
