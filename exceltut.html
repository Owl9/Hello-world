		<h1>Microsoft Excel </h1>
		<font>
		This tutorial assumes that you are already familiar with how to operate Excel or similar spreadsheet software. 
		Here I will show you some techniques that will allow you to move around Excel much faster which will in turn 
		speed up how quickly you can complete your work perhaps at your job or projects you do on your own time.

		<br><br>
		
		First and foremost I will be encouraging you to use ONLY your keyboard for navigating excel in this tutorial. While 
		there are a few things that will obviously require you to use a mouse, like customizing a nice graph or something,
		when it comes to strictly data entry it can all be accomplished by using just your keyboard. Doing this way will also be faster. 
		For our first excercize, let’s get comfortable using the CTRL key. It will be the most used key for inputting shortcuts and 
		hopping from cell to cell. Here is a list of shortcuts that you should know

		<br><br>

		Practice using these shortcuts in a sheet of your own. Try cutting and pasting data from cell to cell and changing
		its appearance with bolding or underlining. Then try saving using the shortcut, selecting everything, deleting it, then
		undoing that to bring it back. You want to get comfortable doing this so that if it happens by accident you will know
		how to fix it and wont lose your progress
		Now let’s try moving around excel with your keyboard. You are probably used to using your mouse to select cells or
		groups of cells but there is a faster way to achieve this. You can either use your arrow keys or the arrow keys on your
		numpad by holding down ctrl. Arguably, using the arrows on your numpad is faster than using your arrow keys because
		your fingers will already be on the bottuns when your ready to enter the data. However it is more difficult to learn and
		do without making mistakes. So it’s up to your preference on which you would like to do but if you are just starting out
		you might want to learn arrow keys first before the numpad.
		Trying moving around the cells using either method and get comfortable with the feeling. Try holding down in once
		direction to get a feel for how fast it will scroll through the page as well.
		Now we are going to go a bit faster. When moving from cell to cell with the arrow keys, you will eventually realize
		that scrolling all the way up or to the side to reach the end of a desired row or column is actually slower than just
		clicking it with your mouse. But of course there is a way to go faster. When moving from cell to cell you can hold
		down CTRL when pressing a direction on your arrow key to instantly skip all cells between your current cell and
		the last cell that contains data in the direction. In the case of a completely blank sheet, top and left will bring
		you to the very first cell in your axis in either direction. And bottom and right will take you to the last cell on that axis,
		which is typically very far away from your starting position. (1,048,576 cells is the cut off). Try making the pattern
		in the picture below to practice this technique. Starting at 1, try to get to the number 9 as quickly as possible only
		using the arrow keys and holding down CTRL the entire time!
		
		<br>
		<img src="pattern.png" width="80%">
		<br>
 
		Now try adding data in between 2 and 3. Notice how you will still skip all of the data as long as all the cells between
		2 and 3 are filled with something. Again, this technique will take you to the last piece of data in a row or column.
		Because we only have one piece of data in each cell with no adjacent data, it’s considered the last cell in the row
		or column. Once you figure this out try making more challenging puzzles of your own to help you get better at
		navigating using Ctrl and a directional input. Experiment with this a lot as it is essentially to moving around Excel quickly.
		
		<br><br>
		
		Now we are going to learn how to use SHIFT + arrow keys. When holding down shift and using the arrow keys,
		it will select all cells between your starting cell and how far you move away using your arrow keys. Using the
		pattern above, start at 1 and hold down shift. Now press the down arrow key until you reach the 2. all cells in
		between as well as the cells containing the 1 and 2 should now be highlighted, as shown below.
 
		<br>
		<img src="dfgdfg.png" width="80%">
		<br>
		
		Now start at 1 again and move cells with yout arrow keys until you’re at the 5. The highlighted cells should look like this.
		
		<br>
		<img src="dfgdfgdfgdfgdfg.png" width="80%">
		<br>
		
		If you haven’t tried it already, attempt to make the selection even faster by holding down shift AND ctrl when
		moving with the arrow keys. Once you are comfortable making selections like this you will be FLYING through
		work on Excel. Your boss will think you’re a god. You’re coworkers will revere you as the second coming of Christ.
		They will give you 6 months paid vacation. You will finish work so fast they will let you just go home. Life just
		gets better once you master moving around like this. You’re going to wish your car was as fast as you are in
		spreadsheet software. Bottom line
 
		<br><br>

		Alright so those are the essentials. Getting around using ctrl and shift should already feel so much better
		than having to use your shitty wireless work mouse to awkwardly find cells. As time goes on, these methods
		will also train you to use the other shortcuts and timesavers in this tutorial.
		LESSON 2:

		<br><br>
		
		Now we are going to take a look at formatting shortcuts. You are already familiar with bolding, underlining,
		and italicizing data by using the shortcuts. But what about when you need to format how the data is organized
		or represented in a cell(s)? For example, how many decimal places you want to show. Or adding commas
		to large numbers. Or representing numbers as dates? The list goes on but it all starts with the formatting
		window which can be easily accessed by pressing CTRL + 1. When you do this a window will pop up that
		gives you everything you need to make your data readable and gorgeous. It will look like this.
		
		<br>
		<img src="dfghdjdgfh.png" width="80%">
		<br>
 
		Now your knee-jerk reaction to seeing a pop up window would be to reach for your mouse and start
		clicking away at to find what you are looking for. Well STOP. As I said before we are done with using
		the mouse for anything other than to shutdown your computer and clock the fuck out for the day.
		This window is easily navigated using just keys and when practiced will be faster and more fluid so
		you can get right back to blasting through data.
		So imagine that there is an invisible cursor on this window that automatically selects whatever it’s
		hovering over. When the window first opens, that imaginary cursor is over the top left tab titled,
		“number”. To move the selection from “number” to “alignment”, “font”, “border”, “fill”, “protection”,
		simply press TAB on your keyboard. Once in your desired tab, you can use the arrow keys to move
		from thing to thing. For boxes that allow you to enter a value, simply start typing the value you want.
		For boxes that need to be checked or unchecked, simply press space. Once you are done with everything,
		press ENTER and your preferences will be applied and the window will close. Woah that’s a lot of shit though.
		Follow along with the pictures below and let’s learn hands on how this works.
