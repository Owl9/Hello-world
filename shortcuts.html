		<h1>Microsoft Excel > Shortcuts </h1>
		Shortcuts are key combinations that allow you to complete a task without having to use your mouse to find
		it in the task bar or otherwise. They are extremely useful staying focused on what you are working on rather
		than fiddling with the software to acheive something. 
		
		These are some basic shortcuts that you find yourself using often.<br><br>
		
		<b>Ctrl + a</b> = Select all. This will select everything on the sheet all at once<br>
		<b>Ctrl + b</b> = Bold. This will bold the data of whatever space you have selected. <br>
		<b>Ctrl + c</b> = Copy. This will copy whatever is currently selected and hold it on your clipboard. Note that when using shortcuts, 
		your clipboard can only hold one item at a time. <br>
		<b>Ctrl + d</b> = Fill Down. This take the data from the cell directly above your currently highlighted cell and copies it to your currently highlighted cell<br>
		<b>Ctrl + e</b> = Flash Fill. This takes a sequence of data and copies the whole column in the column next to it. This one is a bit
		tricky to get to work effectively. I doubt you will get much use out of this one but I listed it in case someone could find an efficient use for it. <br>
		<b>Ctrl + f</b> = Find. This will open a small window that will allow you to type a piece of data and search your document for matching data. Press 
		Enter to cycle through all iterations and Esc to exit the window. <br>
		<b>Ctrl + g</b> = Goto. This will open up a window that will allow you to enter a coordinate and automatically move you to that coordinate. For example A1
		will take you to the very top left of the spreadsheet.<br>
		<b>Ctrl + h</b> = Replace. This will open up a window that, like the Find function, will ask you for data to find. You will also be able to input replacement data. 
		This function will allow you to find all pieces of a certain data point and replace it with new data. For example someones name or an error. <br>
		<b>Ctrl + i</b> = Italicize. This will italicize the data of whatever space you have selected <br>
		<b>Ctrl + n</b> = New. This will open a new and blank document. <br>
		<b>Ctrl + s</b> = Save. This will save your document. Spam this when working so you do not lose your progress!<br>
		<b>Ctrl + u</b> = Underline. This will underline the data of whatever space you have selected. <br>
		<b>Ctrl + v</b> = Paste. This will paste or enter whatever is being held in your clipboard into the currently selected space<br>
		<b>Ctrl + x</b> = Cut. This will cut and remove whatever is currently selected and hold it on your clipboard. <br>
		<b>Ctrl + z</b> = Undo. This will undo the last edit that you did on your current sheet. You can keep going back multiple
		times to undo multiple edits. The memory for this function is only 16 edits however you can edit your registry to extend it up to 100.<br>
		
		
		<br>
		Here are a few more shortcuts that will help you format your data without the need of browsing through windows.<br><br>
		
		<b>Ctrl + Shift + @</b> = Time Format. Input this combination over a cell with data to format it as a time stamp.<br>
		<b>Ctrl + Shift + #</b> = Date Format. Input this combination over a cell with data to format it as a date<br>
		<b>Ctrl + Shift + $</b> = Currency Format. Input this combination over a cell with data to format it as a measure of currency. This will only use your native currency on your keyboard or operating system.<br> 
		<b>Ctrl + Shift + %</b> = Percentage Format. Input this combination over a cell with data to format it as a percentage. Decimal places will be Excels defualts however.<br>
		<b>Ctrl + Shift + ^</b> = Exponential Format. Input this combination over a cell with data to format it as an exponent. For example 123456789 will become 1.23E+08.<br>
		<b>Ctrl + Shift + ~</b> = General Format. Input this combination over a cell to return it to it's original defualt formatting.<br>
		
		<br>
		Now here are some really incredible shortcuts that will allow you to parse through the taskbar without using your mouse!
		<br>
		<br>
		
		<b>Alt + w</b> = Open "View" tab in the top taskbar. From here you will be able to do TONS of things without using your mouse.
		For example when you want to freeze or unfreeze panes you can do <b>Alt + w > F > F</b>. Once you memorize 
		all of the options opened up from this you will be a spreadsheet genius<br>
