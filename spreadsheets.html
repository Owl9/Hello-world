		<h1>Spreadsheet Software</h1>
		
		Spreadhseet software is a wonderful tool that I am very excited to talk about. Some of you 
		will need to be familiar with it for a job or perhaps school work. I personally love it for everyday 
		use though. I manage a lot of personal things using spreadsheets like catelogging my collectibles,
		finances, and making calculators for video games, to name a few. I encourage anyone who
		has a computer of any sort to explore ways to make use of this software as I stongly believe
		it is under appreciated by average users. 
		
		<br><br>
		
		There are a few different spreadsheet applications you can choose from and depending 
		on what you are looking for and your budget, one might be a better fit than the other. 
		However for the purpose of tutorials going forward I will be using Microsoft Excel. The good 
		news is that most if not all of the information going forward will work for any spreadsheet 
		software. So let's see what we have to work with here.

					Excel is my preferred spreadsheet software. This will be the only software
					I will list that will actually cost you money. Though I would argue that the value is there
					with Excel. The value for me comes from
					software updates, clean interface, supported features by other software, and 
					being an 'industry standard' application that may be attractive to potential employers
					for being familiar with. However everything that it has to offer is more or less offered
					in similar spreadsheet software. I will say that Excel handles the largest data sets with 
					the most ease out of the ones I've tested which is especially important to me but may
					not be to others. For 6.99 a month or a 79.99 yearly liscence, you are getting the entire suite which
					is where the value for me really lies because their other applications like Access and Powerpoint
					are objectively better than any other I have used. Word also has the easiest compatibility 
					with websites that allow you to upload documents which was important to me for resumes. 
					If you only plan on using spreadsheets and don't want to spend money, you may be 
					better off with one of the alternatives.<br>

					This is an okay office suite through and through considering it is absolutely free to use. It comes with all
					of the tools that Microsoft Office comes with and it works very well with Linux systems. Their 
					spreadsheet software does work a little differently though. A few of the default settings for punching
					in formulas are different, though changable. It has nice features for customizing the software (like the 
					theme in the screeenshot) but it's power 
					features, like grabbing data from the internet, are a nusance to get working. It's very smooth with 
					standard data sets but lags out terribly with large sets. It's not a bad option and probably one of 
					the best if you're on linux and don't plan on data mining.<br>

					It should come as no surprise that the ever ambitious and expanding enterprise, Google, has made
					their version of just about every popular application out there, including spreadsheets.
					Their approach is pretty unique as it can be used in your browser instead of having
					to download the suite and run it locally on your machine. While that means there is a lack of features
					and usability, this is a huge advantage for portable computers like netbooks or tablets that want to
					make use of spreadsheets	but lack expendable storage options. Google not only runs their software 
					through your browser but storage on Google Drive for all of your workbooks and documents, again, 
					making it extremely lightweight and perfect for use on portable devices. This is the opposite of Microsofts
					portable solutions which I find unusable in pretty much every way. Google Sheets as well 
					as their other office tools are completely free to use including the provided storage. 
					The drawbacks of this portability is of course the lack of handling for large data sets and some power 
					features. A great application but not for everyone.<br>

					If you had asked me about Open Office a couple of years ago I would have told you it was a virus
					and to avoid it like the plague. However I recently re-downloaded their suite, mostly for the purpose
					of making this list, and was impressed with how much better it has become. I can't speak for all 
					of their office tools but I liked their spreadsheet software. It had all of the features an average user 
					would want and it actually handled large, formula rich workbooks rather well. It had okay if not lack-luster
					customization options for the aesthetically motivated user. But packed a lot of options to change key commands
					and keyboard layouts which was it's redeeming quality because a lot of the advanced shortcuts used in 
					Excel are completely different in Open Office. It's bothersome but it can be changed to function differently
					should you not want to relearn those shortcuts using their defaults. It is free to use and has some quirky
					features to make it stand out, like an editing window with some interesting features for editing texts and
					adding clip art. Not perfect but not bad. I'm glad I revisited it though because it deserves a place on this list.
